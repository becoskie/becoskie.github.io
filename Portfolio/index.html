                <p>Like dogs and squirrel.<br>If it has food, wheels and on a street you can't catch me until it's in my mouth.</p><p>Once in New York, I think it was a Honda Civic or some kind of Datsun, I can't remember, but they were serving gyros out of the backseat.<br>This old man in Philly with more gaps than teeth, dunking eggrolls in a bucket of oil in a shopping cart.<br> And the sloppy joes off of one of the nastiest roach coach on the docks in Newark. Yes sir, give me two.</p><p>Now I'm not saying all of it's good. I've had a few in which I needed to get it out right away and decide if need to rub my shoe on it to get that flavor gone, mostly my luck runs strong with street food, those occasions are rare.</p><p>Also, one of my more beloved facets of this predilection is the hunt for a patch of grass to wipe the gooey icky icky off and get back to my day feeling all tidy and in place.</p>
