            <p>Like dogs and squirrel.
            <br>If it has food, wheels and it's on a street you can't catch me until it's in my mouth.</p>
            <p>Once in New York, I think it was a Honda Civic or some kind of Datsun, I can't remember, but they were serving
            gyros out of the backseat.
            <br>This old man in Philly with more gaps than teeth, dunking eggrolls in a bucket of oil in a shopping cart.
            <br> And the Sloppy Joes off of one of the nastiest roach coaches on the docks in Newark. Yes sir, give me
            two.</p>
            <p>Now I'm not saying all of it's good. I've had a few in which I needed to get it out right away and decided
            if I needed to rub my shoe on it to get that flavor gone. Mostly my luck runs strong with street food;
            those occasions are rare.</p>
            <p>Also, one of my more beloved facets of this predilection is the hunt for a patch of grass to wipe the gooey
            icky icky off and get back to my day feeling all tidy and in place.</p>
