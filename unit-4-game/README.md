# Jquery Assignment
Fight a series of characters to win.

## Did some Learning
First the math tripped me up a bit, it's been quite some time. Couldn't even remember what formula to search for, so Google just kept shooting me back irrelevant info. Silly Google. Then I realized I could reverse engineer it with a spreadsheet. Bit scary there for a bit.

Then the mechanics I created in my head seemed solid, but found out I couldn't call the object with a string, at least the way I was doing it. Was pretty dicey, got scared. Then I found eval. JOy. Then the mechanics worked. I think I could use it less. So that will be something to play with in the future.

### Item to work on

Functions
```
Need to push myself to use them more. I set up a playground for them, but haven't had the time.
