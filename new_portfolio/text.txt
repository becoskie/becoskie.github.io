Random words are generated and the user receives number of chances to guess the word based on word length. If the input is correct a tile shows the correct letter, if the guess is wrong it gets removed from the alphabet and the user chances reduce by one. If the user fails to guess the word, the game wins and goes on to the next question leaving the word available for another round. If the user guesses correctly, the tiles change color and a song plays and adding one to the players score.
