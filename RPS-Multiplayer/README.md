# RPS-Multiplayer
Was supposed to create a rock, paper, scissors game with a chat function.
I created an awkward little turd.

## Many, many issues.
So many. Every time I figured out what I thought would work, it would work until I did something new. Then I would have to chase down other issues I didn't know I had.
No clue on when to call listeners, they would work then go bonk. Move them around, no go.
The text box updates once. First message. All the next messages get to the database, but can't get at them.

The score was working until I did something, still don't know how I broke that.

yeah... so frustrating. get it in there, but can't get it out.
